Template String or template literal:
                    in es6 when we want to print string and number together we use back ticks for Example:
                    console.log(`my name is ${name}`) // name="Ali"
                    but in es5 we join or concatenate it using + operatofa-rotate-180

Default paremeter: When we pass value of paramerter on the top of the function  like  function (a,b=10) then b is default paramerter


What is Difference between function paramerter and Argument?
Function Paramerter:
                    " When we define function the value or varible pass on defining the function i.e 
                    funtion std(a,b) here a,b are the argument"
Function Argument: 
                    "When we give value on calling the function "


Rest Parameter(...)
                   Rest opertator used in when parameter of function are less than argument then Rest operation contain the value of all  for example: function name(a,b) if on calling function name("a1","b2","c3") this is a problem so we use name(a,...b) now b parameter have to value b2 and c3

Maths object in es6:
                    two method introduced
                    1) Sign Method: which is used to know nature of value ( +ve or -ve value) 1 and -1 respectiverly
                    2)trunck: return the interger value of varicale i.e a=5.98  the output be  a=5

Promises: 
it has 3 stages
                Senerio: You will be their on 9am
                    1) pending  : waiting or u can say its not 9 am it maybe 7 or 8 am waiting stages
                    2) resolve: u r there 
                    3)reject: u r buzy u r at home or somewhere else
Synchronous vs Asynchronous Programming:
                Synchronous meaning all the work step by step if some function is call trnsfer move to that point 
                first that calling function executes then remaing code load.
                Asynchronous programming mean in js if some calling function called we can paused its execustion 
                timeout for some time then after the remaing code execute the calling function will be printed
